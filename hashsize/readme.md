# Hash size

For 64 and 256 bits super keys, the files are provided. For other sizes, the _sortall.py files need to be edited.

As the algorithms expect a range of table ids, the usage is for example `python3 xash_sortall_256.py 1 10000`.

For MD5, the hash size cannot be changed and no files are provided for this experiment.
